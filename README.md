Description: Basically it does everything what real Akinator does but only for characters in Mushoku Tensei

CSV files: Each CSV works as a checkpoint to not loose the accumilated progress 
  1- all_characters_in_mushoku_tensei.csv is the parsed data  
  2- mishoku_tensei_refined_data.csv is one hot encoded version of all_characters_in_mushoku_tensei.csv and almost model ready
  3- all_characters_base.csv is the model ready ever changing csv file it can be directly used in creation of the Decision tree and is modified each time fined the right character
Other two files have descriptive names and I don't any reason to document it in here
